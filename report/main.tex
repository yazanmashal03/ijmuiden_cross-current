\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and Motivation}
Maritime navigation in complex coastal environments requires precise understanding of hydrodynamic conditions, particularly cross-currents that can significantly impact vessel maneuverability and safety. The Port of Amsterdam, as one of Europe's busiest ports, faces unique challenges due to its location at the intersection of the North Sea and the IJsselmeer, creating complex tidal and wind-driven current patterns.

Traditional forecasting methods rely on simplified physical models that often fail to capture the intricate interactions between multiple environmental factors. This limitation motivates the development of data-driven approaches that can learn complex temporal and spatial relationships from historical measurements.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The primary challenge is to develop a reliable forecasting system that can predict cross-current magnitudes at the IJmuiden measurement station (SPY1) using available environmental data. The system must:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Process and integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources
    \item Handle missing data and temporal inconsistencies
    \item Provide accurate predictions with appropriate uncertainty quantification
    \item Operate in real-time for practical maritime applications
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Objectives}
The main objectives of this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a robust data preprocessing pipeline for environmental measurements
    \item Implement an LSTM-based neural network architecture optimized for time series forecasting
    \item Create comprehensive feature engineering techniques for temporal pattern recognition
    \item Establish reliable model evaluation and validation protocols
    \item Provide a production-ready inference system for real-time predictions
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Description and Preprocessing}

\subsection{Data Sources}
The project utilizes environmental measurements collected from the RWS (Rijkswaterstaat) monitoring network, specifically focusing on the IJmuiden measurement station (SPY1). The dataset comprises five key variables:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
Variable & Description & Unit & Source \\
\midrule
Cross Current & Water current perpendicular to main flow & cm/s & SGA.3 \\
Wind Direction & Wind direction measurement & degrees & WN.2 \\
Wind Speed & Wind velocity magnitude & m/s & WN.4 \\
Water Height & Tidal water level & cm & WT \\
Wave Height & Significant wave height & cm & GH10.1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Environmental variables used in the forecasting model}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data Characteristics}
The dataset spans from January 2015 to July 2025, providing comprehensive coverage of seasonal and tidal patterns. Key characteristics include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Resolution}: 10-minute intervals for all measurements
    \item \textbf{Spatial Coverage}: Single measurement station (SPY1) at coordinates (4.5186, 52.4644)
    \item \textbf{Data Volume}: Approximately 26,000 time points per variable
    \item \textbf{Missing Data}: Handled through interpolation and forward-filling techniques
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing Pipeline}
The preprocessing pipeline addresses several critical challenges:

\subsubsection{Data Ingestion}
Raw data is ingested from RWS API endpoints using a custom Python script that handles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Authentication and rate limiting
    \item Error handling for network failures
    \item Automatic retry mechanisms for failed requests
    \item Data validation and quality checks
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning}
The cleaning process includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Removal of duplicate timestamps
    \item Handling of missing values (denoted by asterisks in raw data)
    \item Outlier detection and removal using statistical methods
    \item Temporal alignment of different measurement sources
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Normalization}
Z-score normalization is applied to all features:
\begin{equation}
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of each feature, respectively. Normalization parameters are saved to ensure consistent preprocessing during inference.

\subsubsection{Feature Engineering}
Temporal features are engineered to capture cyclical patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unix Timestamp}: Continuous time representation
    \item \textbf{Seasonal Decomposition}: Extraction of trend, seasonal, and residual components
    \item \textbf{Lag Features}: Previous time step values for autoregressive modeling
    \item \textbf{Rolling Statistics}: Moving averages and standard deviations
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Architecture}

\subsection{LSTM Network Design}
The core forecasting model employs a flexible LSTM architecture designed specifically for multivariate time series prediction:

\subsubsection{Architecture Overview}
The network consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Layer}: Accepts sequences of 24 time steps with 5 features
    \item \textbf{LSTM Layers}: Configurable depth (1-3 layers) with variable width (64-512 units)
    \item \textbf{Dropout Layers}: Regularization between LSTM layers (20\% dropout)
    \item \textbf{Fully Connected Layers}: Final prediction layers with additional dropout (30\%)
    \item \textbf{Output Layer}: Single neuron for cross-current prediction
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulation}
The LSTM cell implements the following equations:
\begin{align}
f_t &= \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \\
i_t &= \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \\
\tilde{C}_t &= \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) \\
C_t &= f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t \\
o_t &= \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \\
h_t &= o_t * \tanh(C_t)
\end{align}

where $f_t$, $i_t$, $o_t$ are the forget, input, and output gates respectively, and $C_t$ is the cell state.

\subsubsection{Activation Functions}
The model supports multiple activation functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ReLU}: $f(x) = \max(0, x)$ for hidden layers
    \item \textbf{Error Function}: $f(x) = \text{erf}(x)$ for specialized applications
    \item \textbf{Linear}: No activation for output layer (regression task)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Configuration}
The model is trained with the following hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimizer}: Adam with learning rate 0.01
    \item \textbf{Loss Function}: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    \item \textbf{Batch Size}: 32 samples per batch
    \item \textbf{Sequence Length}: 24 time steps (4 hours of data)
    \item \textbf{Learning Rate Scheduling}: ReduceLROnPlateau with patience=5
    \item \textbf{Early Stopping}: Prevents overfitting with patience=10

\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Regularization Techniques}
Multiple regularization strategies are employed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dropout}: Prevents overfitting by randomly zeroing activations
    \item \textbf{Weight Decay}: L2 regularization on model parameters
    \item \textbf{Early Stopping}: Monitors validation loss to prevent overfitting
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learning Rate Scheduling}
The learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on validation performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ReduceLROnPlateau}: Reduces learning rate when validation loss plateaus
    \item \textbf{Factor}: 0.1 (reduces LR by 90\%)
    \item \textbf{Patience}: 5 epochs
    \item \textbf{Minimum LR}: $10^{-6}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Selection}
The best model is selected based on validation performance:
\begin{itemize}
